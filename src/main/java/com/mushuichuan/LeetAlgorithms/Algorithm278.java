 * 278. First Bad Version  QuestionEditorial Solution  My Submissions
 * Total Accepted: 52688
 * Total Submissions: 228829
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
 * <p>
 * Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
 * <p>
 * You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
